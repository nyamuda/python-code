Your Name: Tatenda Nyamuda

1. Take a minute to search the Internet for an explanation of "polymorphism". You might especially consider sources such as StackOverflow and Wikipedia. After reading through some of these, in your own words, describe polymorphism AND why it's useful.
  
   Polymorphism means existing in multiple forms. In programming, there are so many ways polymorphism is implemented.
   For instance, the "+" operator can take multiple forms, that is, it can be used for adding and also for concatenating.
   Polymorphism is especially useful in OOP because it allows you to overide methods that are inherited from other classes.

2. What is the benefit of making an empty abstract method in a base class?

   Abstraction hides the internal functionality of the method from the users. Users of the abstract method only need
   to know "what the method does" and not "how it works". So in other words, abstraction hides away complexity.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
    
   Learning about recursion was really interesting. It was so amazing to learn how recursion works under the hood and
   how it can be used to solve complex problems.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
   
  Was struggling to understand recursion and someone on the group helped me to understand it better by posting 
  a video about it.
