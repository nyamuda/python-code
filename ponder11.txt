Your Name:Tatenda Nyamuda

1. In your own words describe polymorphism.
   
   Polymorphism means existing in multiple forms. One common example of polymorphism is the "+" operator.
   If you're working with values of "int" data type, the "+" operator adds the values and if you're working 
   with values of "str", it concatenates the values. Thus, the "+" operator can be used to add values or
   to concatenate values, meaning, it can take multiple forms and with each form it behaves differently.


2. Briefly describe how polymorphism is used in your project.
   
   In my project, some classes have methods with the same name. These methods however, behave or operate
   differently when invoked. In other words, these methods are polymorphic, that is, they take multiple forms
   in different classes.


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
  
   The most interesting thing I learned was the use of list comprehension. I was really suprised at how powerful
   it is when working with lists/arrays.


4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

   Had some difficulty understanding how exactly to use else/if statements with list comprehension. I did
   some digging online and after seeing some examples, I understood it perfectly.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
 
   No
