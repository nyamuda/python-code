Your Name:

1. Why is it important to avoid updating the position of the object in the on_draw function?

   Because that's when the elements are drawn.


2. Besides game programming, can you think of any other applications that would likely use event-driven programming?
   
  It can be used in web applications. A web application can perfom certain actions like showing the menu, a pop up, changing
  the text or color of the website in response to the input of the user.


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
   
  Learning about stacks was really interesting. I had used the pop() and push() methods before when dealing
  with arrays/lists but didn't know that they were operations of stacks. Learning that a stack is also called
  a LIFO(last in , first out) was interesting as well.


4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

   Tried to help someone who was having problems with the Pong game assignment.


5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
    
  The Arcade libray and the Pong game assignment
 

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 
Checkpoint A - 30 min
Checkpoint B -  20 mins
Team Activity -  1 hour
Data Structures Homework - 1 hour
Prove Assignment - 7 hours
