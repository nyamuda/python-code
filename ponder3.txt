Your Name:

1. In your own words, briefly describe what object-oriented programming means.
 
 OOP is mainly about creating objects using classes. A class consists of a constructor function, 
 variables and member functions.


2. What is the difference between a class and an object?
    
  A class is a blueprint that we use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

  One interesting thing I learned was how the "__init__" function works. It lets you define or initialize
  the variables of the class' instance using the keyword 'self'. 'Self' refers to the class' instance.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

  Helped someone who was having trouble with the robot problem. I suggested the use of an 'if' statement to solve
  the problem he was having.
