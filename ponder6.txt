1. Give a specific example of a time when you might want to override a method from a base class.
   
   If we have an "Lion" base class and it has a method called "animal_sound". If we create another class
   called "Cow"  and inherit from the "Lion" class, then we'll have to overide the "animal_sound" because
   cows and lions have different sounds.


2. Do you think IS-A or HAS-A is a better choice for the team activity (Circles and Points)? Why?
   
   I think learning about the relations IS-A and HAS-A be a bit confusing. So I think
   doing them as a team activity really helps to understand them better.


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

  Learning about Queues was very interesting. Loved learning how Queues are different from Stacks. 
  Stacks are LIFO(last in first, out) and Queues are FIFO (first in , first out).


4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

  
5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?

   The Milestone(Skeet) assignment was really tough for me.
