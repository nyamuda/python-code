Your Name:

1. In your own words, describe encapsulation.
   
   Encapsulation is the process of hiding data from the outside world. We hide the data by making the 
   data private (private variables). That way, you will not be able to access or change the data directly. 
   You will only be able to access or change the data using gettters and setters.


2. What is a benefit of using a property instead of just having a setter function (e.g., set_angle(45))?
   
  If you want to do some validation before setting the value, then using a property allows you to do so.


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
  
   I really enjoyed learning about binary trees. I had heard a lot of people talk about them and how interesting they are.
   I'm really glad I got to learn about them

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

   I struggled alot with the "W08 Prove: Milestone 1 - Asteroids" assigment. I reached out to so many people for help and
