Your Name:

1. Besides the obvious aspect of writing fewer lines of code, what is a benefit of having a method call the methods of an internal object, as opposed to doing the work itself? (E.g., Why is it beneficial for the get_subtotal method of the Order class to make use of methods from the Product class?)

   It makes the code reusable, easy to test and also easy to modify. For instance if I want to change the functionality
   of a method from the Product class, all I have to is to go the Product class and modify the method. I don't have to
   change anything in the other classes the method is used.

2. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
 
   I loved learning more about Lists and Linked Lists. Knowing how they work under the hood, their difference, and the best situations to use them was really interesting. 


3. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

   Someone on the group was having trouble with testing assignment 4. I helped them by showing what was causing the error.


4. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
    
   No


5. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 3 hours
Checkpoint A - 15 mins
Checkpoint B - 20 mins
Team Activity - 1 hour
Data Structures Homework - 2 hours
Prove Assignment - 4 hours
