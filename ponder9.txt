Your Name:

1. Describe a case where you think an error/exception could be used, but should _not_ be used.

   If your program is taking input from a user and if the input has the potential to cause your
   program to stop running or crash due to the input not being valid, then you definitely need 
   to use an error/exception. You can then catch the error and show a custom error message to the user.
   However, if you don't expect your program to crash due to wrong user input, then the error/exception
   should not be used.


2. If method A calls B, and B calls C, and then an error is raised in function C, where can it potentially be caught (A, B, C, or all of the above)?

   All of the above
   


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

   Learning about Hash tables was very interesting. I was really impressed by the fact that Hash tables
   map keys of any data type to values using a "hashing function" and that they have a runtime of O(1)
   for insertion, deletion, and searching.


4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
   
   I really struggled with understanding Hash tables and how to avoid collisions. Had to do a lot of research to understand them.


5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?

   No


6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading -5 hours
Checkpoint A - 20 mins
Checkpoint B - 30 mins
Team Activity - 1 hr 30 mins
Data Structures Homework - 10+ hrs
Prove Assignment - 6 hrs
