Your Name:Tatenda Nyamuda

1. Why would someone use a shell script instead of writing a Python program?
   When you want to execute simple tasks, doing it with shell script will be much 
   simpler than doing it with Python.


2. Why would someone use a Python program instead of writing a shell script?
   
   If you want to build large applications, Python has lots of libraries, is easy to debug
   and the syntax is also easy to read and understand. So you can build almost any application with Python
   easily. Shell script on the other hand, lacks many data structures and functions which makes it
   very difficult to use to build large applications.


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

   I've learned a lot about Pandas and I'm loving it. Doing the data analysis assignment made me 
   understand it better and I think I'm now considering data science as one of my posssible future careers.


4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
  
   The data analysis assignment was very challenging. I had to do read a lot of documentation about
   Pandas and Seaborn. Stakeoverflow also helped a lot especially in regards to some errors I was running into.
