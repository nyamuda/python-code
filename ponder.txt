Your Name: Tatenda Nyamuda

1. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

The most interesting I learned was working with types. As someone coming from JavaScript, JavaScript 
can implicitly change one data type to another, int to string for instance. Python on the other hand,
is a strongly typed language meaning it does not implicitly change one data type into another. It will yell
at you if you try to do that. To change one data type into another, you have to explicitly do that through
type casting.

2. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

There was someone who was having difficulty with their code, so I posted some code to help them.

3. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?

No

4. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2 hours
Checkpoint A - 30 minutes
Checkpoint B - 30 minutes
Prove Assignment - 2 hours
